project prompts:
When building an application what are major components involved?
I can think of data (what we track and how they relate to one another), users, user interface, integrations

Can you fill out all of those bullet points for with an example project and output it as json as if someone submitted a form answering those questions about their project?

Can you continue the online bookstore example and answer those bullet points as if someone submitted a form for their project? Please output it as json

Can you create a couple user persona examples as well based on the demographics mentioned?
