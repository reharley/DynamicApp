### Function Overview: `onInitProjectForm`

#### Purpose:

`onInitProjectForm` initializes a project form with a unique identifier (UUID). This function is triggered during the initialization phase of the project form and ensures that each form instance has a unique identifier.

#### Test Cases:

1. **Form Initialization with UUID:** The function should generate a UUID and assign it as the value of the `id` field in the form instance.
2. **Form Instance Not Found:** If the project form or its instance is not found in the app state, the function should handle this gracefully, typically by logging an error.

#### Mock Setup:

- Mock `appState.getComponent` to return a mock form object.
- Mock `uuidv4` to return a predetermined UUID.
- Spy on `console.error` to check for error handling.

In this implementation, we've defined two test cases:

1. **Form Initialization with UUID:** This test checks if the function correctly initializes the form with a UUID. It mocks the `uuidv4` function to return a predetermined UUID and verifies that this UUID is set as the form's `id`.

2. **Form Instance Not Found:** This test handles the scenario where the project form instance is not found in the app state. It mocks the absence of a form instance and verifies that an error is logged to the console.

The mocking setup is crucial for these tests to run in isolation, without actual dependencies on external libraries or the application's state.
